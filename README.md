# Eikon

A read-only self hostable proxy and gallery for Imgur, inspired by [Kevin](https://git.voidnet.tech/kev)'s ["imgin" project (gitea instance)](https://git.voidnet.tech/kev/imgin), but made in Deno with support for more features.

## Usage

An ideal use case would be [Redirector](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector) which is an extension that redirects Imgur links to your instance, so that only a change of domain would be required without modifying the rest of the URL.
